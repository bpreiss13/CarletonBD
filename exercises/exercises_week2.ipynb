    "Today's exercises will be related to chapters 3, 4, 5 from DSFS. The point of these exercises is to refresh your memory on some mathematics and get you comfortable doing computations in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercises today cover:\n",
    "* Basic visualization\n",
    "* Linear algebra\n",
    "* Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice**: Some of you may be new to solving problems using code. You may be wondering *what level of detail* I expect in your solutions, your code comments and explanations. **This is the guideline:** Solve the exercises in a manner that allows you to—later in life—use them as examples. This also means that you should add code comments when the code isn't self-explanatory or if you're afraid it won't make sense when you look at it with fresh eyes. You may also want to comment on your output in plain text to capture the conclusions you arrive at throughout your analysis. But express yourself succinctly. To quote (probably) Einstein: *\"Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler\"*. Finally, when you optimize for your own future comprehension, other people will be able to understand what you did."

    "1. Make a scatter plot of `x` vs. `y` for the \"blackmirror\" subreddit (**remember** what you learned in the previous exercise about **styling**). Comment on what you see.\n",
    "2. Maybe you've noticed that it looks pretty bad right, in the sense that lots of points are close to each other while a few are far away from the rest? That's because the data does *not scale linearly*! This is a very common thing. To visualize it you should then try to *transform* it somehow. In this case, the data scales *exponentially* in both the x and y direction. Which transformation should we use to make it linear?\n",
    "3. In two separate figures, floating side by side, scatter plot (left) the set of x and y variables for \"blackmirror\" and (right) x and y for \"news\" (you can use [subplots](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.3/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplots.html), for example, to plot two figures sideby side). Remember to transform the data. When I solved this exercise a while back, my figure looked like [this](http://ulfaslak.com/computational_analysis_of_big_data/exer_figures/example_2.2b.png).\n",

    ">*Hint: By \"transformation\" in point 2 and 3 above, I mean that you map some function onto every value in a list of values. Example: I can apply a square root transformation like `x = [np.sqrt(v) for v in x]`. A faster way to do that, of course, would be just `x = np.sqrt(x)`.*"

    "1. Log transform `y` (e.g. create a new variable called `y_transformed`) and input it to `plt.hist`. Notice that if there are zeros in `y`, `np.log` will convert them to `-inf`, which `plt.hist` can't handle. You should therefore remove zeros before log transforming. When you have done this, execute `hist_output = plt.hist(y_transformed)`. This should produce a histogram. But what does the variable `hist_output` contain?  Check out [hist](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.3/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html).\n",

    ">**Ex. 2.2.5**: There's another use of the covariance matrix, other than just learning how features co-vary. In fact, it turns out that the *eigenvectors* of the covariance matrix are a set of mutually orthogonal vectors, that point in the directions of greatest variance in the data. The eigenvector with the greatest *eigenvalue* points along the direction of greatest variation, and so on. This is pretty neat, because if we know along which axes the data is most stretched, we can figure out how best to project it when visualizing it in 2D as a scatter plot! This whole procedure has a name: **Principal Component Analysis** (PCA) and it was invented by Karl Pearson in 1901. It belongs to a powerful class of linear algebra methods called **Matrix Factorization** methods. Ok, so rather than spending too much time on the math of PCA, let's just use the `sklearn` implementation and fit a [PCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) on `X`."

The way to fix this is by doing something called \"[zscoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score)\", whereby each feature is rescaled to have zero mean and unit standard deviation. In this way, all of the data ends up with comparable variance. Make a new array `X_z` that is the zscored `X`, using the `scipy.stats.zscore` function. Show that each column has zero mean and unit standard deviation.\n",

    ">1. If you plotted `x` and `y` against each other, you probably noted that it looks like they correlate. Use the method `pearsonr` from `scipy.stats` to **compute the correlation coefficient**. Notice that the method also gives you the p-value of the correlation. For now, we ignore this.\n",
    ">2. So how do we figure out if this correlation strength is significant? \n",
    "The devil's advocate would surely argue, that you could obtain a similar *or stronger* correlation between completely random data.\n",
    "Well, screw you advocate, because we can SHOW that if you randomize THIS data, the correlation strength is almost always lower!\n",
    "To put this in stat-lingo, the devil's advocate believes in the so-called *Null Hypothesis*–that your result is no different from random–and the way we REJECT this acvocate's pessimistic hypothesis, is simply by comparing OUR obtained correlation strength to one obtained from data we know is random, namely the *Null model*.\n",
    "The Null model, in this case just a randomized version of our existing data. \n",
    "Your job, now, is to take `x` and `y`, randomize them (each independently) and compute the correlation coefficient.\n",
    ">3. In 2. you probably found that the correlation coefficient of the Null model was lower than that of your real data.\n",
    "But that was just one example of the Null hypothesis being wrong.\n",
    "The devil's advocate is not convinced and wants more evidence.\n",
    "Compute again the correlation coefficient of the Null model, but do it in a `for` loop 10000 times, and report the fraction of times that this correlation coefficient is greater or equal to the correlation coefficient of your real data.\n",
    "Maybe it will happen in 0% of randomizaion trials, maybe 2%, but hopefully not more than 5%.\n",
    "Yes, you guessed, it, this fraction is indeed the p-value.\n",
    "So is it really significant?\n",
    ">4. Complete the function below that takes as input `noise_level` and computes a p-value. Let `noise_level` vary between 1 and 50 and plot the p-value as a function of `noise_level` so we can see how our result becomes less and less significant as we increase the noise. Two questions: (1) around which value of `noise_level` does the correlation become insignificant, and (2) which p-value does the curve saturate at for large `noise_level`?"
